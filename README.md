fdb-go
======

[Go language](http://golang.org) bindings for [FoundationDB](https://foundationdb.com), a distributed key-value store with ACID transactions.

This package is currently targetting FoundationDB 1.0.0 (API version 100), and is a **work in progress**. In particular, there is not yet complete coverage of the FoundationDB API, and the interface will almost certainly change in breaking ways.
