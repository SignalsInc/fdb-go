/*
Package fdb provides an interface to FoundationDB 1.0 databases.

Among other things this needs to explain about errors and link to https://foundationdb.com/documentation/api-error-codes.html#developer-guide-error-codes.

Conceptual topics that are not covered in individual API functions and types (or
that would benefit from being reiterated) should be discussed here, linked to,
or both.

Although some examples exist attached to various symbols, we should also add an
example code block to this preamble demonstrating basic use of the package.
